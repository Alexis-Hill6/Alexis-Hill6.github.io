                <p>People who walk around instead of relying on vehicular transportation may at some point feel uncertain about the safety of the street they are walking in, especially if they are new to the area. Having no clue where dangerous areas are located increases the vulnerability of individuals that may not have the option of having a quick getaway car nearby to escape potentially dangerous situations.
